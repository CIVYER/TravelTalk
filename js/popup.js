const description = ["A long trip to Bataan is a must in every traveler\'s life. Bataan is known for being rich in natural wonders such as stunning beaches, majestic mountains, and grandiose waterfalls. That\'s how we decided to go on a 2-day and 1-night trip.\n\nFor our first stop we stayed at Lucky Haven Beach Resort for our accommodations, and I can say that the rooms were well cleaned and neat (I\'ll be putting their FB Page on the links so you can see their rates). The NIGHT BEACH i must say, for me it was the highlight of our trip. I spent my whole night looking at the beach waves and feeling the cold air while drinking coffee; that was really perfect for me.\n\nThe next day, we went to the very famous tourist spot in Bataan, which is Mount Samat. Exploring Mount Samat was a very educational experience; despite the hot weather while climbing, the scenery and museum there made it all worth it.\n\nAfter experiencing the whole trip, it made me feel the true value and essence of our culture. I suggest that you plan this trip well so that you can fully enjoy it!", "I have been to Clark, Pampanga, many times already. It's true that it really gives off those calm and peaceful vibes inside—the cafes, open grounds, convenience stores, and more. One of the famous spots there was the Clark Parade Grounds, also known as CDC Clark. Personally, I just like the feeling of open grounds; I do love spending time looking at a spacious area full of trees, a windy atmosphere, and a pretty sunset while eating my go-to food. But of course I would love to share my experiences with you so that maybe we have the same taste in terms of traveling and enjoying your own precious time. Here's how I planned my peaceful trip to CDC Clark:\n\nPrepare your things. Blankets, small pillows, a tiny basket (if needed), lunchboxes, a bubble maker or blower, a camera (a phone camera can be a dupe for it), essentials, and your personal bag—plus, don't forget your extra money, just in case! Pack them lightly.\n\nIn addition to your food, you can make your own since you're aiming for that picnic thing. But still, there are convenience stores (7/11, Uncle John's (Ministop), fast food chains (Jolibee, Burger King, and Chowking), and coffee shops (Starbucks, etc.) there. The distance was 15–17 minutes' walk from the CDC to food chains; that's why you should prioritize your needs first before going to your destination.", "Hi everyone! So here's how my trip to Baguio went! I\'ve been to Baguio twice already. As for my first-time experience, since I was just 10 by that time, I have no ideas aside from liking the view and the strawberries there. And for the second time (2019), I was knowledgeable enough to analyze the activities we\'ve done there. We went to the most famous attractions, such as Burnham Park, Strawberry Park, Mines View Observation, and more. When it came to bookings and accommodations, we didn\'t really plan this trip well; we went there on the spot. It\'s kind of funny since I looked for booking websites when our trip had already ended. One of the best booking sites that I can recommend is \"trivago.com.ph\". It includes the prices of hotels, transportation, and more. Based on my calculations, your expenses will really depend on your time and the activities you plan to do. As for ours, we had a 3-day trip, and our expenses maybe went around 10,000–15,000 for a family of 7–10.", "Visiting Korea would definitely be a dream come true for some of you, but luckily, a town was created here in the Philippines that showcases the food, vibe, and feel of South Korea. I present to you, Korean Town in Angeles City!\n\nThe moment I visited Korean Town, I felt overwhelmed by the vibe it contained, but take note of this: I highly suggest going there at night. Going there in the morning might be too unfamiliar, and I can't guarantee that it would be nice there when the sun is out. I think I can compare it to 'Itaewon', They actually had the same vibe. There are some cafes and restaurants that you guys might want to try out.\n\nI won't say that this was the best trip ever, but I would say that it's a good starting point for those who are planning to really visit South Korea.", "Manila most travelers see it only as a jump off point to the country’s stunning islands. Outsiders may find it inexplicable, but I love Manila.\n\nBig, crowded, and wild describe Metro Manila. You become lost in the crowd, choke on pollution, or drown in her relentless nagging just as you are beginning your exploration. Those who manage to get past her faults, however, are rewarded with the chance to admire her qualities. So, in order to assist you get to know this underappreciated city better, here is a travel guide.\n\nI suggest you to visit Intramuros. If Manila had a soul, you’d find it hiding inside any ancient structure in Intramuros. The historic core of the capital, it was built in 1571, making it the oldest district in the city. It has survived waves of foreign invasions, a world war, and even booming, unrelenting threats of overdevelopment. But it continues to stand silently amidst the roaring metropolis outside its fortified walls. You can explore Intramuros on your own, but if you want to appreciate it better, it’s best to join a guided tour. Klook has two Intramuros offers: a walking tour and a bamboo bicycle tour.\n\nAfter that, go to Ayala Museum. Private museums abound in Metro Manila, but I prefer the Ayala Museum for its GOLD. The museum, which was founded in 1967, has been holding significant cultural and historical items that will alter the way you view earlier Philippine societies. In addition to countless works of art, its most priceless collection is the 'Gold of Ancestors' exhibition, which features over a thousand gold artifacts and provides indisputable evidence of our ancestors' highly developed way of life, which grew and flourished in the 16th century, even before the Spanish era.", "tropolis where tradition meets innovation. Explore the historic Asakusa district with its famous Senso-ji Temple and Nakamise shopping street. Visit the Imperial Palace, stroll through the upscale neighborhoods of Ginza and Omotesando, and immerse yourself in the bustling atmosphere of Shibuya Crossing.\n\nKyoto - A Glimpse into Japan's Ancient Soul:\nIn Kyoto, we step back in time and enter a world of sublime beauty and Zen tranquility. The enchanting Kinkaku-ji, or Golden Pavilion, leaves us awe-struck, while the mesmerizing Fushimi Inari Shrine enthralls us with its endless rows of vibrant torii gates. We delve into the rich history of geisha culture in the Gion district, savoring matcha tea in traditional tea houses.\n\nSuggestions: Don't just stay in Tokyo. It can be tempting to set your sights on Tokyo and not aim to explore much further. But if you want to get a real sense of what Japan is like, you've got to cast a wider net!\n\nPrepare: Figure out transportation in advance, get a SIM card or pocket wifi, practice English, and understand the culture.", "Our class has been suspended, so my friends and I decided to enjoy our day by going to Lakeshore. We wanted to have a picnic while enjoying the view there. I had high expectations going there because I saw my other friends go there and it made me want to go as well.\n\nHowever, it didn't go as I expected. The place was very meticulous to the point where you wanted to capture the moments, but they didn't allow the use of cameras inside. Additionally, the place was quite dirty. I don't know if we came at the wrong time or day, or if it's always like this.\n\nIt's not that it's a bad place, but it's really not what I expected it to be. That's why I'm so disappointed.", "Bohol holds incredible sights and dive spots that can easily capture anyone's heart. And I deem myself fortunate to have seen its beauty, albeit for a short time.\n\nNow, as you can see, the Chocolate Hills (or as we Filipinos would call it: Tsokolateng Burol) is a unique geological formation comprised of cone-shaped hills that all look identical — almost. From what I've learned, there are at least 1,200 of them that span an area of more than 20 square miles! To be more precise though, these 'hills' are actually made of limestone covered with grass, and they vary in sizes from 30 up to 120 meters in height.\n\nYou might be wondering why they are called as such, and well, they are called that because during the dry season, between the months of December and May, the grass that covers these limestone hills would dry up and turn into a browner color.\n\nMuch like the Chocolate Hills, I was also very excited about the chance of finally witnessing the world-famous tarsier that is said to be the 2nd smallest primate in the world. They are predominantly found in certain parts of Southeast Asia only, one of which is here in Bohol in the Philippines (yep, we're absolutely lucky to have them!)\n\nAs based on my books back in school — and as you can see in the photo — they also look so cute; so naturally, I was looking forward to it a lot!\n\nIf you're looking for a place to stay, I recommend the following:\n· Budget: Alexis Cliff Dive Resort\n· Mid: Panglao Homes Resort & Villas\n· Luxury: Henann Resort Alona Beach\n\nHow to get there:\nCar rentals are also possible, of course, and the rental shops are mainly found in Tagbilaran with a starting cost of $31~ (Php 1,500).","My trip to Baler was a truly unforgettable experience. Baler is a coastal town located in the province of Aurora and known for its stunning beaches, scenic views, and vibrant local culture. Here's a glimpse of what you can expect on your trip.\n\nMy trip started when I was 18; it was my birthday, and I told my family that I really wanted to go to Baler. I was so happy that they agreed.\n\nOur trip started at 4:00 am in the morning, and I was still sleepy but excited at the same time. I love traveling at midnight, but I easily get nauseous due to long drives. This is where the challenge started.\n\nIf you are like me and easily get dizzy due to long drives, I suggest you bring medicine like Biogesic and Bonamine, because on your way to Baler, you will encounter a zigzag road that is really long. This road made me vomit, but I tried hard to hold back because I didn't want to interrupt our trip.\n\nThen our tire got flat; our trip became truly memorable.\n\nWe arrived at 6 or 7 am in Baler, and after all the struggle, seeing Baler made me realize that this trip was really worth it. Just by looking at and hearing the waves of the beach gave me a calm and peaceful vibe that I wanted.\n\nI suggest you go to the Millennium Tree, which is the BIGGEST BALETE TREE IN ASIA. That tree is over 600 years old and over 65 meters in height. Then we went to Museo de Baler, which gives you a cultural vibe. The people there are very welcoming. Since we were not familiar with the place, we hired a guide to help us tour and enjoy Museo de Baler.\n\nThen we bought some food at the mall and went to the beach. It was already night. I suggest you bring some tents, blankets, a camera, and small pillows. We set up the tents near the beach and enjoyed the view. Don't forget to take pictures as you enjoy the moment.\n\nPrepare things like tents, blankets, pillows, a camera, and don't forget to bring extra money!", "If you're planning a trip to Zambales, here are some specific suggestions to make the most of your visit:\n\n1. Visit Anawangin Cove: This picturesque cove is one of the most popular destinations in Zambales. Surrounded by pine trees and with its unique ash-gray sand, it offers a tranquil atmosphere for camping, swimming, and enjoying the scenic beauty. You can also hike to nearby peaks for breathtaking views.\n\n2. If you're a surfing enthusiast or want to try it out, head to San Felipe. The coastline here offers consistent waves that are perfect for both beginners and experienced surfers. Liw-Liwa Beach is a popular spot for surfing, with several surf camps and rental shops available.\n\n3. You can also visit Subic Bay, which is not technically part of Zambales, but it is worth a visit. You can explore attractions like Ocean Adventure, Subic Safari, and the Treetop Adventure Park. Additionally, you can enjoy water sports, go-karting, and shopping in this vibrant area.\n\nI suggest checking the weather conditions and planning your activities accordingly. Zambales offers a mix of natural wonders and adventure opportunities, allowing you to create an unforgettable trip filled with beautiful landscapes and exciting experiences.\n\nMake sure to pack appropriate clothing, water and snacks, extra money, and follow any safety guidelines or protocols in place.","Hello, Peeps! Itsyagurl here with another great tourist recommendation. This time I visited Okinawa, Japan's beautiful beaches. One of my favorites was Naminoue Beach, which boasts a stunning white sandy beach.
